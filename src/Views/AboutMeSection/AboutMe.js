            I am a happy and smiling boy of 21 years, who lives in SÃ¸ndervangen
            by Viby J. I traveled from Pakistan to Denmark as a 1-year-old and
            started life in Denmark. I went to Tranbjergskolen (primary school).
            Subsequently, I started on the Higher Technical Exam (HTX) in the
            line Information Technology B and Mathematics A as I was interested
            in IT.

            I started the multimedia designer education in the year 2020 and am
            currently in the 2nd semester where I will soon start with the exam
            project. I chose this training in that it is a mixture of
            programming, design and communication, thus one learns all aspects
            related to the development of user interfaces.
